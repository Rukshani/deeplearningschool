You’ve heard the hype about artificial intelligence.

[Billions of
dollars](https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/15/vcs-determined-to-replace-your-job-keep-ais-funding-surge-rolling-in-q2/)
in VC funding are flowing yearly to Silicon Valley startups attempting to use AI
to revolutionize fields from
[healthcare](https://deepmind.com/applied/deepmind-health/working-nhs/health-research-tomorrow/)
to [manufacturing](https://www.instrumental.com/) to [contract
law](http://www.rossintelligence.com/) to [cybernetics](https://neuralink.com/).
The fastest
[supercomputers](https://www.nextplatform.com/2017/03/28/scaling-deep-learning-beyond-18000-gpus/)
in the world are being harnessed to run massively-parallel, ever-larger “deep
neural networks”.

report on the newest research advances.

And then there’s the thinkpieces, full of bold claims and futuristic
speculation. AI will cure world hunger. AI will take over everyone’s jobs and
make us all obsolete. AI will usher in a new era of global consciousness and
immanentize the eschaton. AI is…the Next Big Thing.

So, the question is — *why?* Why is everyone so excited about artificial
intelligence? What’s behind the big AI boom? And can you use AI to tackle
practical challenges— not 20 years in the future, but today?

### Insight #1: \(Narrow\) AI is all around you.

A common misconception about artificial intelligence is that it is a thing of
the future. As John McCarthy — one of the founders of the field — famously
complained,

> “as soon as it works, no one calls it AI anymore.”

In fact, we are surrounded by “narrow” artificial intelligences that make our
lives easier and save us time in innumerable ways — though we don’t usually
think of them as AI.

* Amazon’s bizarrely prescient [product

* Parking assist systems that warn you when you get too close to the curb.
* Spam filters. Airplane landing technology. Siri. Pandora. Roombas. And much
more.

As these tools become increasingly flexible, we’ll give them far more
responsibility. Pilot drivers for [Waymo](https://waymo.com/) (formerly Google’s
self-driving car project) and [Tesla Autopilot](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot)
already trust their *lives* to software. In the end, the seductive allure of
using tools that make us faster and automate away drudgery can never be
underestimated, especially when there’s just so *much* drudgery to be automated
—- in medicine and in law, at work and at home, in the virtual and in the
physical world.

### Insight #2: (Deep) AI is smarter than you.

Yet while some people build programs to do what humans won’t, others dream of
creating intelligences that do what we *can’t*. Of course, we’ve been building
technology to rectify our faults for millennia. But with the power of [deep
learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)* -- * a newly-popular
subfield of machine learning and AI -— we can achieve a whole lot more.

Deep learning involves incredibly complex, abstract mathematical structures
called “neural networks”; these networks look vaguely reminiscent of the human
brain and can be taught to predict, classify, or generate almost anything. \(If
you stick with this course, you’ll learn far more about deep learning, but for
now we’ll leave it at that.\)

With enough computational power, deep neural networks can surpass humans on many
intellectual battlegrounds. The famous [AlphaGo versus Lee
Sedol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol) matches showed
this decisively, with Google’s [self-trained
AI](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/) handily beating the reigning world
champion in Go, an ancient Chinese strategy game of immense complexity.

Business). Go was once thought impossible for machines to play: it has more
board positions \($10^170$\) than there are *atoms in the universe.*</span>

On the right tasks, these networks can also show glimmers of genuine creativity.

But perhaps more interesting is when deep learning helps us *augment* our
understanding and our reach in exponential ways. Through, for example,
[detecting subtle cellular
patterns](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841514001819) in
vast microscopy images, patterns that can profile tumors more accurately than
physicians every could. Or developing [generative
models](http://www.astro.ethz.ch/schawinski/research/research-projects/deep-learning-and-big-data-in-astrophysics.html)
to forecast the morphology and formation of galaxies.

methods. Right: [galaxy

using generative adversarial networks (GANs).</span>

When neural networks help you understand the secrets of life and the poetry of
the stars, it becomes hard to deny that there’s real **intelligence** behind the
complex computations. Intelligence that could help us in the same ways that
narrow AI currently helps us, except **exponentially** more effectively.

No wonder people are excited.
